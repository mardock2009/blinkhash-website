This repository is a custom-built website intended to serve the documentation for Blinkhash's various services. It was written using the ReactJS/NextJS framework, and is currently hosted at https://blinkhash.com/docs.

#### Need Support?

If you need help with a code-related matter, the first place to look is our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8xtHZFKJQY), where the developers will be available to answer any questions. However, please do not come to me with issues regarding setup. Use Google and the existing documentation for that.
