export const mission = `
It's no secret that mining pools, and the mining process as a whole, has been becoming
more and more centralized, especially for smaller altcoins, where a single pool is most
often responsible for the majority of the hashrate. Blinkhash was created to solve this
problem, and to simplify the process of creating, hosting, and managing a mining pool
for the layman. Anyone should be able to setup and host a mining pool with minimal
difficulties.
`;

export const browse = `
The selection of mining pools that are currently active and running on the platform
is the best way to start mining immediately. Featured pools were created and are
actively managed by the Blinkhash developers, while the rest were built using the
tools provided by the Blinkhash ecosystem.
`;

export const create = `
The Blinkhash ecosystem allows users to create and host their own mining pools with
minimal difficulties by leveraging Foundation, our open-source mining pool solution.
With extensive documentation and tutorials to help with getting started, it's never
been easier to be a pool owner.
